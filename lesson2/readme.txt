C as you know is a typed language which means you must tell the compiler
what type a variable is

the built in types are

int - integer
char - single character
float - floating point number
double - higher precision floating point number

these are the basic building blocks of all data that is used in a program

you declare a variable by first fining the type then the variable name

eg.

int myInteger = 0; // remember to add the semi-colon at the end
char myCharacter = 'c'; // characters are enclosed by '' NOT ""
float kensFloat = 3.142f; // the suffix f means it is a float, not a double
double bensDouble = 3.142;
